# Leukemia_Image_Classification
This group project used a CNN to analyze blood smear images to differentiate between cancerous Acure Lymphoblastic Leukemia, or ALL, and healthy cells.  These cells are notoriously difficult to differentiate because of the subject-level variability of lymphocytes.
Below is a sample of the raw images as well as their labels, highlighting the challenge of differentiating healthy from cancerous cells.
